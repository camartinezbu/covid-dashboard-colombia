# Covid Dashboard Replica using shinydashboard

Data visualization is a useful tool to transform raw data into actionable information for decision making in many contexts, including the current covid-19 pandemic.

In this exercise, I try to replicate the Covid dashboard designed by the Colombian National Health Institute -INS- availiable in this [page](https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/paginas/coronavirus.aspx), using the shiny and shinydashboard packages in R.
